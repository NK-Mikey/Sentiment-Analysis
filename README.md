üè∞ Disneyland Guest Review Analysis
This project analyzes over 40,000 guest reviews from Disneyland parks in California, Paris, and Hong Kong to uncover patterns in customer satisfaction. Using natural language processing and sentiment analysis, we identify key themes behind positive and negative experiences, compare sentiment across locations, and evaluate how well star ratings align with review text.

Objectives:
- Discover top drivers of guest satisfaction and complaints
- Compare review sentiment across global park locations
- Provide actionable insights to improve guest experience

Tools: Python, pandas, scikit-learn, NLTK, spaCy, Plotly, WordCloud
Methods: EDA, Text preprocessing, TF-IDF, sentiment analysis (Lexicon), topic modeling (LDA), n-gram analysis, and data visualization

Expected Outputs:
- Sentiment and theme breakdown by park
- Alignment between text sentiment and star ratings
- Informative visualizations and park-specific recommendations
